        'FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/black-adam-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n"Black Adam is far from impressive, being somewhat disappointing due to its formulaic, predictable screenplay when something different was anticipated.\r\n\r\nLorne Balfe\'s epic score and a magnificent cast - Dwayne Johnson, Aldis Hodge, and most remarkably Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal - try to elevate the decent action and visuals, but the moderate entertainment levels don\'t make up for the dated narrative structure.\r\n\r\nTiresomely heavy exposition, story with little to no creativity, and inconsistent humor make it impossible for the DCEU to take "the next step" in a truly impactful manner."\r\n\r\nRating: C+',

        'With a horrid script, lackluster performances, and a waste of potentially awesome characters, _Black Adam_ is an explosive, $195 million, anti-heroic dud. The DCEU is about to get way more convoluted and underwhelming than ever before if this is the future of live action DC films.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Black-Adam-20220-Review-A-Stale-and-Disjointed-Antihero-Kerfuffle',

        '**Black Adam might not reinvent the wheel, but it doesn’t have to. It just wants to take you on a fun, entertaining, exciting superhero ride!**\r\n\r\nBlack Adam has its haters, and I can understand why. It doesn’t necessarily break new ground in the superhero genre, but that doesn’t stop it from being awesome! Action-packed from start to finish. The effects are incredible. I kept myself from saying Wow out loud on multiple occasions. Dwayne Johnson’s Black Adam is absolutely ruthless, ripping armies of henchmen with ease and speed. I was worried a PG-13 rating might soften his brutality, but it did not! The action sequences looked amazing and were well done. I really liked the Justice Society characters, although they all felt a little stereotypical with a SpiderMan jokester, a wise old Professor X, and a quipping leader in the vain of Wolverine or Deadshot. Pierce Brosnan was perfect at Dr. Fate, making me wish he hadn’t been relegated to special guest star status. The movie didn’t waste a ton of time giving background on each character which was wise with so many new heroes on screen. The film had its moments of cheese but didn’t overdo it. Definitely watch the mid-credit scene. It’s stupendous! Black Adam was a fine addition to the superhero genre, and I look forward to what comes next.',

        "> _\"My powers are not a gift. They're a curse, born out of rage.\"_\r\n\r\nI had a blast watching this in theaters. This was very bombastic, with a lot of cool action, but also telling a heartfelt story about Black Adam.\r\n\r\nIt was very inventive how they depicted Black Adam's origin, keeping it a mystery up near the end. Dwayne Johnson was born to play Black Adam. He steals every scene he's in playing a badass anto-hero.\r\n\r\nNow the Justice Society, while they didn't have a backstory in the film, they each had prequel comics detailing their backstory. Which I really dig, these comics are meant to sell comics, after all. Might as well get the audience to buy the comics to get into some great stories (they are also currently doing this with The Flash). The movie actually starts right where the Doctor Fate prequel comic ends, so I don't think it's apographa. Doctor Fate played by Pierce Brosnan was a standout. He really put his all into this character. Aldis Hodge was also a standout as Hawkman.\r\n\r\nThe surprise villain of Black Adam, Sabbac, was a really good addition to the Shazam! mythos. If the wizards have their own champion, why doesn't the seven deadly sins have one? Sabbac is the answer to that. Doctor Fate's battle with him was really cool.\r\n\r\nOverall, this wasn't as bad as the critics were saying, I had a fun time! Be sure to stay for the mid-credits scene!",

        'In search of the all powerful crown of "Sabbac", "Adrianna" (Sarah Shahi) unleashes "Seth-Adam" (Dwayne Johnson) from his mountain-encased tomb deep in the desert. With super-human powers akin to "Superman", he returns to his home city of "Kahndaq" which is under the control of the "Intergangs". Will he decide to help her and her son "Amon" (Bodhi Sabongui) free them from this criminal tyranny? Well what nobody had counted on are the folks from the Justice League/Brotherhood/Department - led by "Hawkman" (Aldis Hodge) and "Dr. Fate" (Pierce Brosnan) who have decided that "Adam" is a bit of an wrong-un and so bring their state-of-the-art rocket ship as well as the "Atom Smasher" (Noah Centineo) and "Cyclone" (Quintessa Swindell) to capture or destroy him. Thing is, "Adam" is the stuff of legend to these people - reputedly having defeated an ancient despotic king - but is/was he all that he seemed? Is he good or evil or both? Well, to be honest I didn\'t really care. This is a very well produced and technically superb creative effort, but the story is all over the place and the repetitive combat scenes just grate after a while. Johnson has charisma, we have seen it loads of times, but here he exudes none. Hodge looks great in his winged-suit but again, his character is as deep as an Ethiopian river in July. Centineo has some fun as the giant - more than a passing resemblance to Mark Ruffalo, don\'t you think? Otherwise the rest of this is about as derivative as it comes. Hopefully this is just a one-off, as this is nobody\'s finest work and is up there with "Morbius" as a superhero film too many!',

        '_Black Adam_ is in every aspect a generic superhero movie. There is nothing that really separates this for me, besides the body count that Black Adam stacks up during the film.\r\n\r\nOne thing I need to mention is the audio quality. So many lines of dialogue sound like they were recorded straight off from a cell phone. They do not match the scene at all and it was incredibly jarring throughout the entirety of the film. While I am talking about sound, in almost every fight scene the film included a badass rap song. It was cool the first time, but it got old and corny fast.\r\n\r\nThe plot was very generic from all aspects. It suffers by trying to catch the audience up in the first act. The film introduces the Justice Society and Black Adam and quickly accelerates the plot to start the main conflict of the film. It felt rushed and the conflict between the JSA and Black Adam was forced, nothing about it felt genuine. The villian in this movie was so forgettable, by the time he is introduced the conflict is over. I had zero emotional attachment to anyone in this movie. The dialogue was pretty bad as well, the scenes constantly switched from serious to comedy causing both aspects to fall flat for me.\r\n\r\nThe performances were okay, everyone was pretty average including Dwayne Johnson. Nothing spectacular and nothing bad enough for me to notice.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was excited for this new phase and direction of the DCEU and was left disappointed. Definitely one of the poorer movies in the franchise.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _48%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Average_',
